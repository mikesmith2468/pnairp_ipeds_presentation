# pnairp_ipeds_presentation
Accompanying content for "Doing IPEDS Analysis the Easy Way," a presentation at PNAIRP 2019

This presentation would not be possible without the work of Jason Bryer, Ph.D., who developed the ipeds package on which it relies.

Contents:

- The presentation slides
- Three .Rmd markdown documents, comprising an introduction (with setup instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux) and two example analyses
- PDFs and HTML renders of the above three markdown documents
- R data files for IPEDS collection years 2012-2018. These are only needed for Windows users; Mac and Linux folks can make their own.

I hope that you will find these examples useful! If you do anything cool with them, I'd love to see it.
